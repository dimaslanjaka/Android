# About
A implementation of `SharedPreferences` which syncs with Firebase database to keep your `SharedPreferences` in sync between multiple devices of one user and/or to back them up for app re-installs!

The usage is pretty simple and straight forward if you have ever worked with `SharedPreferences`. You can also easily use them with `PreferenceFragment`.

This project contains a exmaple app, take a look how you can use `SharedFirebasePreferences`!

# Setup
Add this to your project level build.gradle:
```
allprojects {
  repositories {
    ...
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
  }
}
```

Add this to your app level build.gradle:
```
dependencies {
  compile 'com.github.crysxd:shared-firebase-preferences:1.0.1'
}
```
# Firebase Setup
As this library uses Firebase, please follow [this](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup) guide to setup Firebase in your project. Please note that your users must be signed in with Firebase to use the `SharedFirebasePreferences` properly (you still can use anonymous login at Firebase, but this would destroy the basis for this library), sou you should also follow [this](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/android/start/) and setup a working login for your users.

# Get a Instance
To get a instance of `SharedFirebasePreferences`, simply call `SharedFirebasePreferences.getInstance(this, "app_settings", Context.MODE_PRIVATE)` where `this` is a `Context`and `app_settings`is the name of the preferences. You can also call `SharedFirebasePreferences.getDefaultInstance(this)` to get the default instance e.g. used by `PreferenceFragment`. Please note that `FirebaseAuth.getInstance().getCurrentUser()` must not be null when getting an instance! This means a user must be signed in with Firebase.

# Sync Data
Simply call `SharedFirebasePreferences#pull()` to get the lastest values from the server. Note that you can add a `OnFetchCompleteListener`to the returned object to get updates about the pulling e.g. when it is completed. You can use `SharedFirebasePreferences#push()` to push the local data to the server. This method returns a `Task<Void>` to which listeners can be attached. Also calling `prefs.edit().put("greeting", "Hello World!").apply()` or `prefs.edit().put("greeting", "Hello World!").commit()` will automatically push the changes to the server.

You can use `SharedFirebasePreferences#keepSynced(true)` to keep the data in-sync with the server while the app is running. You will be informed about changes via the `SharedPreferences.OnSharedPreferenceChangeListener` attached to the preferences. Please remember to call `SharedFirebasePreferences#keepSynced(false)` when your app/activity enters the background!

# Omit Values
You can call `omitKeys(String...)` on any `SharedFirebasePreferences` to omit certain keys from being pushed to Firebase. This may be handy if e.g. certain keys containing sensitiv user data or data which should be limited for to the current install time.

# Use with PreferenceFragment
You must override the `attachBaseContext(Context newBase)`  method in the `Activity` hosting the `PreferenceFragment` to use `SharedFirebasePreferences` with it:

```
@Override
protected void attachBaseContext(Context newBase) {
    super.attachBaseContext(new SharedFirebasePreferencesContextWrapper(newBase));
}
 ```

Then simply attach the `PreferenceFragment` to the activity as usual, it will use a `SharedFirebasePreference` instance to store and receive the preferences! Changes made to the prefernces by the user will be instantely synced with the database.

# Database Strucutre
As default the preferences are stored in your database at `/shared_prefs/$uid/$name` where `$uid` is the uid of the user signed in and `$name` is the name passed to `SharedFirebasePreferences.getInstance(Context, String, int)`. You can adjust this path by calling `SharedFirebasePreferences#setPathPattern(String)` like this:

```
SharedFirebasePreferences.setPathPattern(String.format(Locale.ENGLISH, "users/%s/shared_prefs/%s", UID_PLACEHOLDER, NAME_PLACEHOLDER));
```
Please note that the pattern is not applied to `SharedFirebasePreferences` instances already created with `SharedFirebasePreferences.getInstance(...)` in the past. All `.`, `#`, `$`, `[` and `]` int the path (including the name) will be replace with `-` in order to satisfy Firebase's requirements for paths in the database. This means the `SharedFirebasePrefernces` called `com.test.prefs` and `com-test-prefs` will be the same!

# Securing your Data
It is strongly recommended to secure the user's data in your Firebase database using rules. You can use these rules for the default path pattern:

```
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": "false",
    ".write": "false",
    "shared_prefs": {
      "$uid": {
        ".write": "$uid === auth.uid",
        ".read": "$uid === auth.uid"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
This set of rules allows users only to read and write to their `/shared_prefs/$uid` node.
